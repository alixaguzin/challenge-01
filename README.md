# Code Refactor Starter Code
This project is a website that is dedicated to the Horiseon company, in order to raise awareness about their products. They discuss search engine optimization, online reputation management, and social media marketing on this website. They also briefly discuss lead generation, brand awareness, and cost management. Here is the link to the basic website with this information that I designed for Horiseon: https://alixaguzin.github.io/challenge-01/
